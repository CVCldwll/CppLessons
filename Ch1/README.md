# Hello, World
## Programs
- because computers are really "dumb"
## The classic first program
- special characters
- importing facilities from libraries
- main function
## Compilation
- source code vs. object code
- zero tolerance for errors in code
## Linking
- puts together separate parts (modules, translation units)
- produces the executable file
- accessing declarations from libraries
- compile-time errors found by compiler
- run-time errors, logic errors found by linker (more difficult to fix)
## Programming environments
- command line
- IDE with "helpful" features  ðŸ¤®
## Drill
- import std; will not work; using #include<iostream>
- cl.exe compiler was not working
- MinGW seems to work with example code at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw
